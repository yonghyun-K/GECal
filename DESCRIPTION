Description: Generalized Entropy Calibration produces calibration weights 
    using generalized entropy as the objective function for optimization. 
    This approach, as implemented in the 'GECal' package, is based on 
    Kwon, Kim, and Qiu (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.01076>. Unlike 
    traditional methods, 'GECal' incorporates design weights into the 
    constraints to maintain design consistency, rather than including 
    them in the objective function itself.
