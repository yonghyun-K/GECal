Title: Generalized Entropy Calibration (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yonghyun Kwon
Maintainer: Yonghyun Kwon <yhkwon@iastate.edu>
Description: Generalized Entropy Calibration produces calibration weights based on generalized entropy as the objective function for optimization. In GECcal, design weights play a role in the constraints to ensure design consistency, rather than being part of the objective function.
